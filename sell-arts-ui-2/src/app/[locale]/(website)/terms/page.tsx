          <strong>Advertising</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          SellArts does not offer advertising linked to the profile but only to the context of the pages consulted: the promotion areas display sponsored works, which appear on the home page or inside the site and can display, for example, works of the type &quot;sculpture&quot; if you visit the
          sculpture page, or &quot;painting&quot; if you visit the painting page.
        </p>
        <p>If no advertising is available, we may use external service providers, such as Google Ad Exchange, which displays advertising based on your profile. You can consult the details of Google&#39;s GDPR compliance on their dedicated page.</p>
        <p>
          Some advertisers use advertising management platforms external to SellArts. In this case, we do not program a banner, but a &quot;tag&quot; that dynamically calls the client&#39;s advertisements. The client may have access to some basic connection data (IP address, for example), but never
          to the data of SellArts members. To oppose this, you can manage access rights via these platforms.

          <strong>1.4.7 Fair Use Policy for Selling Artists on SellArts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>SellArts is committed to prioritizing the quality and authenticity of the works displayed on the platform. Thus, Selling Artists must respect the following guidelines:</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Originality:</strong> Selling Artists must only upload works that they have created themselves and for which they own all necessary rights. Reproductions of other artists&#39; works or any content that infringes on the intellectual property rights of others are strictly prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Artistic Value:</strong> Selling Artists are encouraged to present their best works, those that reflect a high standard of artistic value. SellArts reserves the right to review and remove any content that does not meet our quality criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Fair Use Compliance:</strong> While “fair use” allows for the use of copyrighted material in certain contexts such as criticism, commentary, or education, artists are not permitted to reproduce or distribute copyrighted material without permission on our platform. Failure to comply
          with these guidelines may result in disciplinary action against the artist’s account, up to and including permanent termination. SellArts encourages all Selling Artists to be respectful, original, and positively contribute to the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.5 Financial Terms for SellArts</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Artworks sold on SellArts:</strong> For each order received by a Selling Artist, SellArts will receive a commission in the amount set out in the “Selling Commissions” section, plus shipping and VAT. The commission is applied to the entire order (price of the artwork + shipping and
          any other fees). For example, for an artist subject to a sales commission of 35% (excluding VAT): for a work sold at 100,000 CFA francs, including shipping costs, SellArts will apply a rate of 35%, or 35,000 CFA francs of commission.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>VAT on sales commissions:</strong> If the selling Artist resides in an ECOWAS/UEMOA country, the applicable VAT is that of the country of residence. For example, in Côte d&#39;Ivoire, the VAT is 18%. For an artist subject to a sales commission of 35% excluding tax, the commission
          with VAT will be 35% x 1.18 \= 41.3%. For a work sold at 100,000 CFA francs, the sales commission with VAT will therefore be 41,300 CFA francs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Payment terms:</strong> SellArts will pay the selling Artist the full amount of the order, less the commission, after confirmation of receipt of the work by the Buyer and once the withdrawal period has expired. Payment will be made to the selling Artist&#39;s bank account indicated
          on his SellArts account. In the absence of confirmation of receipt of the work by the Buyer, and if no dispute has been received within the time limit, SellArts will consider the work as received 45 days after the shipping date. In the event of a dispute regarding the receipt of the work,
          SellArts will take the necessary measures to resolve the problem, including reimbursing the Buyer if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Sales commissions:</strong> SellArts will receive a commission of 30% for accounts benefiting from the Premium service at the time of sale, and 35% for other types of accounts. For Selling Artists resident in countries where VAT applies, it will be collected in addition and
          automatically transferred to the country of residence.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1.6 Suspension and termination on SellArts</strong>
        </p>
